# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Study Guide  
**Connecting the EVM with Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Solidity**  
*Inspired by "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" and OS Principles*

---

The EVM is a stack-based, 16-bit word-oriented virtual machine.

| Stack-based VM             | Stack machines (e.g., JVM, Forth)      | Process execution model                   |
| Gas metering               | Performance cost (CPI, cycles)         | Resource quotas (CPU time, memory limits) |
| Storage (Persistent State) | Non-volatile memory (disk)             | File system / persistent storage          |
| Memory (Temporary)         | RAM                                    | Heap allocation                           |
| Execution Environment      | ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)     | Process isolation / sandboxing            |
| Contract Calls             | Function calls / procedure linkage     | Inter-process communication (IPC)         |
| Opcodes                    | Machine instructions                   | System calls                              |
| Reverts / Exceptions       | Exception handling (traps, interrupts) | Signal handling / process termination     |
